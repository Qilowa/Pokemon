Project Pokemon done by Théo and Quentin

Start the program

To start the project, you need to start the Menu class.
We did some parts of the project in a graphical way. For example, the Menu of selection and the Pokedex is in a graphic Layout.

Also, we are part of the intership group so we had to do the project until the steps V but we did the step VI and a we started step VII.


Technical choices

We used the files given to load the pokedex but we had to find another document with the statistics of each pokemon.
Those stats are contained in the FightingPokemon class because we did not want to overcharge the Pokemon class.
